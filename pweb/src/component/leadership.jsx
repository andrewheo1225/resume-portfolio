                Collaborated in constructing a new elementary school, cement
                road that connects the school to their homes, removing trash and
                litter from various habitats, and extracting potential trees
                that could harm a studentâ€™s health. Educated elementary students

                to specific habitats, remove litter and non-biodegradable trash,
                and advocated for increasing awareness of climate change and
                ecosystem preservation.
